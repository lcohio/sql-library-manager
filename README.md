# SQL Library Manager

## To run the application, npm install on the root folder, and open http://localhost:3000.

This project uses technologies such as Node.js, NPM, SQL, Sequelize.js ORM, Express web framework and Pug template engine. I've built a Library Management System that allows the client to interact with the SQLite Database. The application uses all CRUD methods in SQL. The user can add, update and delete books from the database. The application also use Sequelize validations to make sure all of the required inputs are populated.
